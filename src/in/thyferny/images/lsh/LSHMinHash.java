         * It can be shown that, using MinHash, the probability that the 
         * signatures of 2 sets with Jaccard similarity s agree in all the 
         * rows of at least one stage (band), and therefore become a candidate 
         * pair, is 1−(1−s^R)^b
         * where R = signature_size / b (number of rows in a stage/band)
         * Thus, the curve that shows the probability that 2 items fall in the 
         * same bucket for at least one of the stages, as a function of their 
         * Jaccard index similarity, has a S shape.
         * The threshold (the value of similarity at which the probability of 
         * becoming a candidate is 1/2) is a function of the number of stages 
         * (s, or bands b in the book) and the signature size:
         * threshold ≃ (1/s)^(1/R)
         * Hence the signature size can be computed as:
         * R = ln(1/s) / ln(threshold)
         * signature_size = R * b
